Before diving in, let's establish a **sound library** — reusable variables that embody DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. This approach, covered in depth in [Strudel Programming](/learn/theory/strudel-programming), lets us define sounds once and apply them everywhere.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`// === THEME LIBRARY ===
// Our main theme (Pachelbel-inspired in D major)
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const themeHigh = note("a4 b4 cs5 d5 e5 d5 cs5 b4")

// === INSTRUMENT PRESETS ===
const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const softPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.6)
const quietPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.4)

// === ARTICULATION LIBRARY ===
const art = {
  legato: x => x.sustain(1),
  staccato: x => x.sustain(0.2),
  marcato: x => x.sustain(0.5).gain(0.9),
  tenuto: x => x.sustain(0.9).gain(0.7),
  portato: x => x.sustain(0.6)
}

// === DYNAMICS LIBRARY ===
const dyn = {
  pp: x => x.gain(0.1),
  p: x => x.gain(0.3),
  mp: x => x.gain(0.5),
  mf: x => x.gain(0.6),
  f: x => x.gain(0.8),
  ff: x => x.gain(0.9)
}

// === TEMPO PRESETS (cpm values) ===
const tempo = {
  largo: 15,
  adagio: 25,
  andante: 30,
  moderato: 40,
  allegro: 50,
  presto: 60
}

// === BASS PRESETS ===
const warmBass = x => x.s('sawtooth').lpf(400).gain(0.4)

// Try the theme with different presets!
piano(theme).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} />

These variables become your **instrument palette**. Now every example can reference `theme`, `piano()`, `art.legato`, and `tempo.moderato` instead of repeating `.s('piano').cpm(40)` everywhere.

Classical music is architecture in time. Like a building, it has **structure** (form), **support systems** (harmony), and **intricate details** (counterpoint). This page teaches you the vocabulary that composers, performers, and transcribers use to describe their art—and shows you how these concepts map to Strudel.

**What you'll learn:**
- How music is organized over time (Form & Structure)
- How chords create emotional meaning (Harmony & Progression)
- How multiple voices interact (Texture & Counterpoint)

Throughout this guide, we'll use a simple theme in D major—inspired by Pachelbel's Canon—to demonstrate each concept:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`// Using our theme variable from the library above
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

piano(theme).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

---

## Part 1: The Journey of a Theme (Form & Structure)

Form describes how music unfolds over time. Just as a story has a beginning, middle, and end, music has structural units that give it shape.

### 1.1 The Musical Sentence: Phrases and Periods

A **phrase** is the musical equivalent of a sentence—a complete musical thought with a beginning, middle, and end. Most phrases are 4 or 8 bars long.

**A 4-bar phrase:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// A complete musical thought
const phrase = note("d4 fs4 a4 fs4 d4 a3 fs3 d3")

piano(phrase).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Two phrases often pair together to form a **period**—a musical "question and answer":

- The **antecedent** (first phrase) ends with a sense of incompleteness
- The **consequent** (second phrase) provides resolution

**A period with antecedent and consequent:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Question and answer
const antecedent = note("d4 fs4 a4 fs4 e4 g4 fs4 e4")
const consequent = note("d4 fs4 a4 fs4 d4 a3 fs3 d3")

piano(cat(antecedent, consequent)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The first phrase feels like a question; the second feels like an answer. This tension and resolution is fundamental to classical music.

A **cadence** is the harmonic punctuation at the end of a phrase. We'll explore cadences in depth in Part 2.

---

### 1.2 Building Sections: Binary and Ternary Form

Phrases combine into larger sections. The simplest structures are:

**Binary Form (AB)**: Two contrasting sections

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Define sections once, use everywhere
const sectionA = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const sectionB = note("a4 b4 cs5 d5 e5 d5 cs5 b4")

piano(slowcat(sectionA, sectionB)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Section A presents one idea; Section B presents a contrasting idea. Many Baroque dance movements use binary form.

**Ternary Form (ABA)**: A section, contrasting middle, return to A

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

const sectionA = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const sectionB = note("a4 b4 cs5 d5 e5 d5 cs5 b4")

// ABA - same sectionA variable used twice!
piano(slowcat(sectionA, sectionB, sectionA)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The return to A creates a satisfying sense of closure. Minuets and many song forms use ABA structure.

**Rounded Binary**: A hybrid where the A material returns at the end of the B section, making it feel like A-B-A' (a modified return).

In Strudel, `cat()` sequences patterns one after another, while `slowcat()` gives each pattern a full cycle—perfect for defining formal sections.

---

### 1.3 Large-Scale Design: Sonata and Rondo

Larger works use more elaborate forms:

**Rondo (ABACA or ABACABA)**: A recurring theme (refrain) alternates with contrasting sections (episodes).

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Refrain and episodes
const refrain = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const episodeB = note("a4 gs4 a4 b4 cs5 b4 a4 gs4")
const episodeC = note("d5 cs5 b4 a4 g4 fs4 e4 d4")

// ABACA - refrain appears 3 times, but defined only once!
piano(slowcat(refrain, episodeB, refrain, episodeC, refrain)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The **refrain** (A) keeps returning, providing unity. The **episodes** (B, C) provide variety.

**Sonata Form** is the most important large-scale form in classical music. It has three main sections:

1. **Exposition**: Introduces two contrasting themes, usually in different keys
2. **Development**: Transforms and explores the themes through modulation and fragmentation
3. **Recapitulation**: Returns both themes, now in the home key

Sonata form creates a dramatic arc: departure, adventure, and homecoming.

**Coda**: A concluding section that follows the main structure, providing a definitive ending.

---

### 1.4 Motivic Development Techniques

Composers transform themes using specific techniques. These are the building blocks of development sections and variations.

**Augmentation**: Stretching note durations (usually doubling them). Creates grandeur and weight.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Same theme - original then augmented
cat(
  piano(theme),
  piano(theme).slow(2)  // .slow(2) doubles durations
).cpm(60)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

In Strudel, `.slow(2)` doubles all note durations.

**Diminution**: Compressing note durations (usually halving them). Creates urgency and excitement.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Same theme - original then diminished
cat(
  piano(theme),
  piano(theme).fast(2)  // .fast(2) halves durations
).cpm(40)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

In Strudel, `.fast(2)` halves all note durations.

**Inversion**: Flipping intervals upside down. If the original goes up a 3rd, the inversion goes down a 3rd.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const softPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.7)

const ascending = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")
const descending = note("d4 c4 b3 a3 g3 f3 e3 d3")  // inverted

stack(
  piano(ascending),
  softPiano(descending)
).cpm(40)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The second line mirrors the first—ascending becomes descending.

**Retrograde**: Playing the melody backwards.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Same theme variable - forward then backward
cat(
  piano(theme),
  piano(theme).rev()  // .rev() reverses the pattern
).cpm(40)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

In Strudel, `.rev()` reverses the pattern. Bach used retrograde extensively in his canons.

**Fragmentation**: Breaking a theme into smaller motives and developing just those pieces.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Extract motives from the theme
const motiveA = note("fs4 e4")  // first two notes
const motiveB = note("b3 cs4")  // last two notes

cat(
  piano(theme),
  piano(motiveA.fast(4)),  // spin out first motive
  piano(motiveB.fast(4))   // spin out last motive
).cpm(40)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Taking just the first two notes or last two notes and spinning them out creates coherent development.

**Sequence**: Repeating a pattern at successively higher or lower pitch levels.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')

// Define pattern once, transpose for sequence
const motif = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4")

cat(
  piano(motif),
  piano(motif).transpose(2),   // up a step
  piano(motif).transpose(4),   // up again
  piano(motif).transpose(5)    // up once more
).cpm(50)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Sequences create momentum and can drive modulations to new keys.

## Part 2: The Language of Emotion (Harmony & Progression)

Harmony is the vocabulary of emotion. It's what makes music feel tense or relaxed, happy or sad, expectant or resolved.

### 2.1 Home and Journey: Tonal Function

In tonal music, every piece has a "home" chord called the **tonic**. The journey away from home and back creates musical drama.

The three primary functions are:

- **Tonic (I)**: Home, stability, rest
- **Dominant (V)**: Tension, needs resolution, pulls toward home
- **Subdominant (IV)**: Departure, gentle contrast from home

**The most basic progression: I - IV - V - I**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const tempo = { largo: 15, adagio: 20 }

// I - IV - V - I in D major
const basicProg = chord("<D G A D>")

voicedPiano(basicProg).cpm(tempo.adagio)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

This progression represents: home → departure → tension → home. It's the foundation of Western harmony.

**Function** describes a chord's role in creating tension or stability. A chord's function matters more than its specific notes.

**Resolution** is the movement from tension to stability—typically V → I. This pull toward home is what gives tonal music its sense of direction.

---

### 2.2 Musical Punctuation: Cadences

**Cadences** are harmonic punctuation marks. They signal the end of phrases and create different degrees of finality.

**Authentic Cadence (V → I)**: The strongest ending. Like a period.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const tempo = { largo: 15 }

// Define cadence types as reusable progressions
const cadence = {
  authentic: chord("<A D>"),      // V → I
  half: chord("<D G A>"),         // ends on V
  plagal: chord("<G D>"),         // IV → I (Amen)
  deceptive: chord("<A Bm>")      // V → vi (surprise!)
}

voicedPiano(cadence.authentic).cpm(tempo.largo)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

This is also called a **perfect cadence** when both chords are in root position and the melody ends on the tonic.

**Half Cadence (→ V)**: Ends on the dominant. Like a comma—pause but not complete.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const cadence = { half: chord("<D G A>") }

voicedPiano(cadence.half).cpm(15)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The phrase feels suspended, waiting for continuation.

**Plagal Cadence (IV → I)**: The "Amen" cadence. Softer than authentic.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const cadence = { plagal: chord("<G D>") }

voicedPiano(cadence.plagal).cpm(15)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Often used at the end of hymns and to reinforce a final tonic.

**Deceptive Cadence (V → vi)**: Surprise! Resolves to the relative minor instead of home.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const cadence = { deceptive: chord("<A Bm>") }

voicedPiano(cadence.deceptive).cpm(15)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The listener expects resolution but gets an unexpected turn. Composers use this to extend phrases or create emotional surprise.

---

### 2.3 Tension and Release: Dissonance

**Consonance** is stability—notes that sound "at rest" together.
**Dissonance** is tension—notes that create friction and want to resolve.

The interplay between them is the heartbeat of classical music.

**Suspension**: A note held over from the previous chord, creating dissonance before resolving down.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')

// Suspension creates tension, then resolves
const suspension = chord("<Dsus D>")

voicedPiano(suspension).cpm(15)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The suspended 4th (G) clashes with the chord, then resolves to the 3rd (F#).

**Non-chord tones** are melodic decorations that create momentary dissonance:

- **Passing tone**: Moves stepwise between two chord tones
- **Neighbor tone**: Steps away from and returns to a chord tone
- **Appoggiatura**: Leaps to a dissonance, resolves by step

These ornaments add expressiveness to otherwise plain melodies.

**Without ornamental dissonance:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Just chord tones - plain
const chordTones = note("d4 fs4 a4 d5")

piano(chordTones).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**With passing tones and neighbors:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Added passing tones fill the gaps
const withPassingTones = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

piano(withPassingTones).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

---

### 2.4 Changing Scenery: Modulation

**Modulation** is moving from one key to another. It refreshes the listener's ear and creates large-scale harmonic drama.

**Common modulations:**
- To the **dominant** (up a 5th): D major → A major
- To the **relative minor**: D major → B minor
- To the **subdominant** (up a 4th): D major → G major

A **pivot chord** belongs to both the old and new key, creating a smooth transition.

**Modulation from D major to A major using E as pivot:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const tempo = { adagio: 20 }

// Pivot chord modulation: D major → A major
const modulateToDominant = chord("<D A Bm E7 A>")

voicedPiano(modulateToDominant).cpm(tempo.adagio)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The Bm chord belongs to D major, but E7 strongly suggests A major. The final A chord confirms we've arrived in a new key.

A **sequence** is a pattern repeated at different pitch levels, often used to create modulations:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Define once, transpose to create sequence
const motif = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4")

cat(
  piano(motif),
  piano(motif).transpose(2),
  piano(motif).transpose(4)
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The same melodic pattern moves up stepwise, naturally shifting the harmonic center.

The **circle of fifths** describes the relationship between keys. Moving around the circle (C → G → D → A → E...) is the most natural way to modulate.

---

### 2.5 Advanced Harmony: Chromaticism and Color

Beyond basic diatonic harmony, composers use chromatic techniques for richer emotional expression.

**Secondary Dominants (V/V, V/vi, etc.)**: A dominant chord that temporarily "points to" a chord other than the tonic.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const tempo = { adagio: 20 }

// Secondary dominant: E7 is V/V (pulls to A)
const withSecondaryDom = chord("<D E7 A D>")

voicedPiano(withSecondaryDom).cpm(tempo.adagio)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The E7 is V/V—the dominant of A (which is V of D). It creates a stronger pull to the A chord.

**Borrowed Chords (Modal Mixture)**: Chords "borrowed" from the parallel minor or major key.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const tempo = { adagio: 20 }

// Gm is borrowed from D minor - bittersweet color
const withBorrowed = chord("<D G Gm D>")

voicedPiano(withBorrowed).cpm(tempo.adagio)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The Gm is borrowed from D minor. This bittersweet color is common in Romantic music.

**Neapolitan Chord (♭II)**: A major chord built on the lowered second scale degree. Creates intense pre-dominant tension.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const tempo = { adagio: 20 }

// Neapolitan: Eb is bII in D minor - dramatic!
const neapolitan = chord("<Dm Eb A7 Dm>")

voicedPiano(neapolitan).cpm(tempo.adagio)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The E♭ major chord (♭II in D minor) has a darkly dramatic quality, often used before cadences.

**Augmented Sixth Chords**: Chromatic chords containing an augmented sixth interval. They resolve powerfully to the dominant.

The three types are named after countries:
- **Italian 6th**: Three notes (♭6, 1, #4)
- **French 6th**: Four notes (♭6, 1, 2, #4)
- **German 6th**: Four notes (♭6, 1, ♭3, #4)

**Pedal Point (Pedal Tone)**: A sustained or repeated note (usually the tonic or dominant) while harmonies change above it.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano')
const warmBass = x => x.s('sawtooth').lpf(400).gain(0.5)
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Harmony changes above a sustained tonic pedal
const chords = chord("<D A Bm G A D>")
const pedalTone = note("d2 d2 d2 d2 d2 d2")

stack(
  voicedPiano(chords),
  warmBass(pedalTone)
).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The sustained D creates tension as other chords move, then release when harmony returns to D.

**Tonicization**: Briefly treating a non-tonic chord as if it were the tonic, usually with its own V-I motion.

**Chromaticism**: Using notes outside the diatonic scale for color and expression. Became increasingly common from Baroque through Romantic periods.

For hands-on practice building progressions with these harmonic concepts, see the [Chord Composition](/learn/theory/chord-composition) guide.

## Part 3: Voices in Conversation (Texture & Counterpoint)

Texture describes how musical voices interact. A single melody is simple; multiple independent melodies weaving together is complex.

### 3.1 How Voices Relate: Texture Types

**Monophony**: A single melodic line with no accompaniment.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Single unaccompanied melody
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

piano(theme).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Gregorian chant and unaccompanied folk songs are monophonic.

**Homophony**: A melody with chordal accompaniment. The melody dominates; chords support.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const softPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.6)
const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano').gain(0.6)
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Melody + accompaniment (reuse theme)
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const accompaniment = chord("<D A Bm F#m G D G A>")

stack(
  piano(theme),
  voicedPiano(accompaniment)
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Most popular music and many classical works are homophonic.

**Polyphony**: Multiple independent melodic lines of equal importance.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const softPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.7)
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Two independent melodies - equal importance
const voiceHigh = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const voiceLow = note("d4 cs4 b3 a3 g3 fs3 g3 a3")

stack(
  piano(voiceHigh),
  softPiano(voiceLow)
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Each voice has its own melodic interest. Fugues and Renaissance motets are polyphonic.

**Heterophony**: Multiple voices play variations of the same melody simultaneously. Common in folk traditions.

Strudel's `stack()` function is the key to building textures—it layers patterns to play simultaneously.

---

### 3.2 Independent Lines: Voice Leading

**Voice leading** is the art of moving smoothly from chord to chord. Good voice leading makes each voice sound like a melody, not just chord notes.

**Types of motion between voices:**

- **Parallel motion**: Voices move in the same direction by the same interval
- **Similar motion**: Voices move in the same direction by different intervals
- **Contrary motion**: Voices move in opposite directions
- **Oblique motion**: One voice stays still while the other moves

**Contrary motion creates independence:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Soprano ascends while bass descends
const soprano = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 g4 fs4 e4")
const bass = note("d3 cs3 b2 a2 g2 a2 b2 cs3")

stack(
  piano(soprano),
  piano(bass)
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

When one voice ascends while another descends, each line maintains its identity.

**Rules classical composers follow:**
- Avoid parallel fifths and octaves (they weaken independence)
- Move by step when possible (smoother than leaps)
- Let outer voices (soprano and bass) have the most melodic interest

For practical voice leading exercises and chord voicing techniques, see the [Chord Composition](/learn/theory/chord-composition) guide.

---

### 3.3 Echoes and Shadows: Imitation

**Imitation** is when one voice echoes what another voice just played. It's a powerful way to unify a composition while maintaining independence.

**Canon**: Strict imitation where a second voice enters after a delay, playing the exact same melody.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const softPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.7)
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Same theme, delayed - canon!
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

stack(
  piano(theme),
  softPiano(theme).late(0.5)  // .late() creates the delay
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Pachelbel's Canon is the most famous example. In Strudel, `.late()` creates the delay.

**Fugue**: A more complex imitative form with:
- **Subject**: The main theme
- **Answer**: The subject transposed (usually to the dominant)
- **Countersubject**: A contrasting melody that accompanies the answer

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const softPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.7)
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Define subject once, derive answer from it
const subject = note("d4 fs4 a4 g4 fs4 e4 d4 cs4")
const answer = note("a3 cs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 gs3")  // transposed to dominant

cat(
  piano(subject),                    // Subject enters alone
  stack(piano(subject), softPiano(answer))  // Answer joins
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The subject enters alone, then the answer joins with the subject continuing as counterpoint.

**Stretto**: When imitative entries overlap closely, creating intensity.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Same motif, increasingly close entries
const motif = note("d4 fs4 a4 d5")

stack(
  piano(motif),
  piano(motif).late(0.25).gain(0.8),
  piano(motif).late(0.5).gain(0.6)
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Tight overlapping creates climactic intensity. Composers often save stretto for near the end of a fugue.

For a complete tutorial on writing canons and fugues, see the [Classical Music](/learn/genre/classical) genre guide.

### 3.4 Advanced Counterpoint Concepts

**Species Counterpoint**: A pedagogical method for learning counterpoint, developed by Johann Fux (1725). Each "species" adds rhythmic complexity:

1. **First Species**: Note against note (1:1)
2. **Second Species**: Two notes against one (2:1)
3. **Third Species**: Four notes against one (4:1)
4. **Fourth Species**: Syncopated, using suspensions
5. **Fifth Species**: "Florid" counterpoint combining all species

**Invertible (Double) Counterpoint**: Two melodies that sound good when either is on top. The voices can swap positions.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const softPiano = x => x.s('piano').gain(0.7)
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Define melodies once
const melodyA = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 g4 fs4 e4")
const melodyB = note("fs3 g3 a3 b3 cs4 b3 a3 g3")

cat(
  // Original position
  stack(piano(melodyA), softPiano(melodyB)),
  // Swapped - same melodies, inverted position!
  stack(piano(melodyB), softPiano(melodyA))
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The same two melodies, but swapped between high and low voices.

**Triple/Quadruple Counterpoint**: Three or four melodies that work in any vertical arrangement.

**Free Counterpoint**: Counterpoint that doesn't strictly follow species rules but maintains good voice leading principles.

**Imitative Counterpoint**: Counterpoint based on imitation (canons, fugues). Voices enter with the same or similar material.

**Non-Imitative Counterpoint**: Independent melodies that complement each other without direct imitation.

---

### 3.5 Vertical Dimension: Intervals and Spacing

**Intervals** describe the distance between notes:

| Interval | Half-steps | Character |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Unison | 0 | Identity |
| Minor 2nd | 1 | Very dissonant |
| Major 2nd | 2 | Mildly dissonant |
| Minor 3rd | 3 | Sad, minor quality |
| Major 3rd | 4 | Bright, major quality |
| Perfect 4th | 5 | Open, medieval |
| Perfect 5th | 7 | Hollow, stable |
| Octave | 12 | Reinforcement |

**Spacing** affects the sound's character:

**Close position**: Notes clustered together (warm, dense)

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')

// D major triad in close voicing
const closeVoicing = note("[d4,fs4,a4]")

piano(closeVoicing)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Open position**: Notes spread apart (clear, majestic)

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')

// Same notes spread across octaves
const openVoicing = note("[d3,a3,fs4]")

piano(openVoicing)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Octave doubling**: Playing the same note in multiple octaves adds richness without changing the harmony.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')

// Root doubled in multiple octaves
const withDoubling = note("[d2,d3,d4,fs4,a4]")

piano(withDoubling)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

## Part 4: Performance Terminology

Classical scores contain Italian (and sometimes German or French) terms that tell performers how to play. Understanding these terms helps you interpret and recreate classical music in Strudel.

### 4.1 Tempo Markings

Tempo indicates the speed of the music, measured in beats per minute (BPM).

| Term | Meaning | BPM Range |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Grave** | Very slow, solemn | 25-45 |
| **Largo** | Broad, very slow | 40-60 |
| **Larghetto** | Rather slow | 60-66 |
| **Lento** | Slow | 45-60 |
| **Adagio** | Slow, at ease | 66-76 |
| **Adagietto** | Rather slow | 72-76 |
| **Andante** | Walking pace | 76-108 |
| **Andantino** | Slightly faster than andante | 80-108 |
| **Moderato** | Moderate speed | 108-120 |
| **Allegretto** | Moderately fast | 112-120 |
| **Allegro** | Fast, lively | 120-168 |
| **Vivace** | Lively, brisk | 140-176 |
| **Presto** | Very fast | 168-200 |
| **Prestissimo** | As fast as possible | 200+ |

**Tempo modifiers:**
- **Molto**: Very (molto allegro = very fast)
- **Poco**: A little (poco adagio = a little slow)
- **Più**: More (più mosso = more motion/faster)
- **Meno**: Less (meno mosso = less motion/slower)
- **Non troppo**: Not too much (allegro non troppo = fast but not too fast)
- **Assai**: Very/enough (allegro assai = quite fast)

**Tempo changes:**
- **Accelerando (accel.)**: Gradually getting faster
- **Ritardando (rit.)**: Gradually getting slower
- **Rallentando (rall.)**: Gradually slowing down
- **Ritenuto**: Immediately slower
- **A tempo**: Return to the original tempo
- **Tempo primo**: Return to the first tempo
- **Rubato**: "Stolen time"—flexible tempo for expression

In Strudel, use `.cpm()` (cycles per minute) to set tempo. Here's the same phrase at different tempos:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')

// Define theme once, tempo library for reuse
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const tempo = {
  largo: 15,      // very slow
  andante: 25,    // walking pace
  allegro: 40,    // fast
  presto: 60      // very fast
}

// Change tempo.largo to tempo.allegro etc. to hear difference!
piano(theme).cpm(tempo.largo)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Largo (very slow, broad):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const tempo = { largo: 15 }

piano(theme).cpm(tempo.largo)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Andante (walking pace):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const tempo = { andante: 25 }

piano(theme).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Allegro (fast, lively):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const tempo = { allegro: 40 }

piano(theme).cpm(tempo.allegro)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Presto (very fast):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const tempo = { presto: 60 }

piano(theme).cpm(tempo.presto)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Accelerando (gradually faster):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Accelerando: tempo sweeps from slow to fast
const accelerando = slow(8, sine.range(20, 50))

piano(theme).cpm(accelerando)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Ritardando (gradually slower):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Ritardando: tempo sweeps from fast to slow
const ritardando = slow(8, sine.range(50, 20))

piano(theme).cpm(ritardando)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

---

### 4.2 Dynamics

Dynamics indicate volume and intensity.

| Symbol | Term | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| **ppp** | Pianississimo | As soft as possible |
| **pp** | Pianissimo | Very soft |
| **p** | Piano | Soft |
| **mp** | Mezzo piano | Moderately soft |
| **mf** | Mezzo forte | Moderately loud |
| **f** | Forte | Loud |
| **ff** | Fortissimo | Very loud |
| **fff** | Fortississimo | As loud as possible |

**Dynamic changes:**
- **Crescendo (cresc.)**: Gradually getting louder
- **Decrescendo/Diminuendo (decresc./dim.)**: Gradually getting softer
- **Sforzando (sfz)**: Sudden strong accent
- **Sforzato (sf)**: Forced, accented
- **Fortepiano (fp)**: Loud then immediately soft
- **Subito (sub.)**: Suddenly (subito piano = suddenly soft)

In Strudel, use `.gain()` for dynamics. Define a dynamics library:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30, moderato: 40 }

// Dynamics library - reusable gain presets
const dyn = {
  pp: x => x.gain(0.1),    // pianissimo
  p: x => x.gain(0.2),     // piano
  mp: x => x.gain(0.4),    // mezzo piano
  mf: x => x.gain(0.6),    // mezzo forte
  f: x => x.gain(0.8),     // forte
  ff: x => x.gain(0.9)     // fortissimo
}

const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Try different dynamics!
dyn.pp(piano(theme)).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Piano (soft) vs Forte (loud):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const dyn = { p: x => x.gain(0.2), f: x => x.gain(0.8) }
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

const phraseA = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4")
const phraseB = note("b3 a3 b3 cs4")

// Same phrases, different dynamics
cat(
  dyn.p(piano(phraseA)),
  dyn.f(piano(phraseB))
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Pianissimo (pp) - very soft:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const dyn = { pp: x => x.gain(0.1) }
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

dyn.pp(piano(theme)).cpm(30)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Fortissimo (ff) - very loud:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const dyn = { ff: x => x.gain(0.9) }
const theme = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")

dyn.ff(piano(theme)).cpm(30)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Crescendo (gradually louder):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

// Signal creates gradual volume increase
const crescendo = saw.range(0.2, 0.9)

piano(scale).gain(crescendo).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Diminuendo (gradually softer):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }
const scale = note("d5 cs5 b4 a4 g4 fs4 e4 d4")

// Signal creates gradual volume decrease
const diminuendo = saw.range(0.9, 0.2)

piano(scale).gain(diminuendo).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Sforzando (sfz) - sudden accent:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

// Pattern-based accents
const sfzPattern = "0.3 0.3 0.3 0.9 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.9"

piano(scale).gain(sfzPattern).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Fortepiano (fp) - loud then immediately soft:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }
const chord = note("[d4,fs4,a4,d5] ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~")

// fp pattern: loud first note, soft sustain
const fpPattern = "0.9 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3"

piano(chord).gain(fpPattern).sustain(2).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

---

### 4.3 Articulation

Articulation describes how individual notes are attacked and released. Define an articulation library:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

// Articulation library - reusable sustain presets
const art = {
  legato: x => x.sustain(1),
  staccato: x => x.sustain(0.2),
  tenuto: x => x.sustain(0.9).gain(0.7),
  portato: x => x.sustain(0.6),
  marcato: x => x.sustain(0.5).gain(0.9)
}

// Try different articulations!
art.legato(piano(scale)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Legato**: Smooth and connected. Notes flow into each other with no gaps.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const art = { legato: x => x.sustain(1) }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

art.legato(piano(scale)).cpm(40)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Staccato**: Short and detached. Each note is crisp and separated.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const art = { staccato: x => x.sustain(0.2) }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

art.staccato(piano(scale)).cpm(40)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Marcato**: Marked, accented. Each note is emphasized with a strong attack.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

// Marcato: accented pattern with medium sustain
const art = { marcato: x => x.sustain(0.5).gain("0.9 0.6 0.9 0.6 0.9 0.6 0.9 0.6") }

art.marcato(piano(scale)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Each note has a pronounced attack. In Strudel, combine higher `.gain()` with moderate `.sustain()`.

**Tenuto**: Held. Notes are sustained for their full value, connected but with slight separation.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

// Tenuto: nearly full sustain with moderate volume
const art = { tenuto: x => x.sustain(0.9).gain(0.7) }

art.tenuto(piano(scale)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Notes are held nearly their full duration, creating a weighted, singing quality.

**Portato (Portamento)**: Between legato and staccato—slightly detached but not as short as staccato.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

const art = { portato: x => x.sustain(0.6) }

art.portato(piano(scale)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Notes are separated but not clipped—a gentle articulation often indicated by dots under a slur.

**Accent (>)**: Emphasize the note with extra attack.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }
const scale = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 b4 cs5 d5")

// Accent pattern emphasizes beat 1 and 5
const accentPattern = "0.9 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.9 0.5 0.5 0.5"

piano(scale).gain(accentPattern).sustain(0.7).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Accents mark structural beats or important melodic notes.

**Fermata (𝄐)**: Hold the note longer than its written value, at the performer's discretion.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const art = { legato: x => x.sustain(1) }
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// @3 gives note 3x normal duration - fermata!
const withFermata = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 [a4@3] b4 cs5 d5")

art.legato(piano(withFermata)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The `@3` gives the A three times its normal duration, simulating a fermata hold.

**Combining articulations** - legato phrase followed by staccato:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Articulation library
const art = {
  legato: x => x.sustain(1),
  staccato: x => x.sustain(0.2)
}

const phraseA = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4")
const phraseB = note("a4 b4 cs5 d5")

// Same melody, different articulations per phrase
cat(
  art.legato(piano(phraseA)),
  art.staccato(piano(phraseB))
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

---

### 4.4 Expression and Mood

These terms describe the character or feeling of the music. Tempo, dynamics, and articulation combine to create different moods. Here's an expression library:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')

// Expression presets combine tempo, dynamics, and articulation
const mood = {
  cantabile: x => x.sustain(1.5).gain(0.6),     // singing
  dolce: x => x.sustain(1).gain(0.35),          // sweet
  conBrio: x => x.sustain(0.5).gain("0.9 0.6"), // vigorous
  leggiero: x => x.sustain(0.2).gain(0.3),      // light
  pesante: x => x.sustain(0.8).gain(0.85)       // heavy
}

const tempo = {
  largo: 15, adagio: 20, andante: 25,
  allegro: 55, presto: 60
}

const agitatedDynamics = "0.7 0.5 0.8 0.5 0.7 0.5 0.8 0.6"

piano(agitatedPattern).sustain(0.3).gain(agitatedDynamics).cpm(tempo.vivace)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Misterioso** - Mysterious. Soft, slow, with unusual intervals or harmonies.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { largo: 15 }

// Two mysterious, sparse voices
const voiceA = note("d4 ~ eb4 ~ a3 ~ d4")

### 4.5 Ornamentation

Ornaments are decorative notes that embellish the main melody. They add expressiveness and showcase virtuosity.

**Trill (tr)**: Rapid alternation between a note and the note above it.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Trill pattern on D
const trillOnD = note("d4 [e4 d4]*8 e4 fs4 g4 a4")

piano(trillOnD).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

In Baroque music, trills typically start on the upper note. In Classical and Romantic music, they usually start on the main note.

**Mordent**: A rapid alternation with an adjacent note—quicker than a trill.
- **Upper mordent**: Main note → note above → main note
- **Lower mordent**: Main note → note below → main note

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Upper mordents on D and G
const withMordents = note("[d4 e4 d4] fs4 [g4 a4 g4] b4")

piano(withMordents).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Turn**: A four-note figure: upper neighbor → main note → lower neighbor → main note.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Turns on D and F#
const withTurns = note("[e4 d4 cs4 d4] fs4 [g4 fs4 e4 fs4] a4")

piano(withTurns).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Appoggiatura**: A "leaning" note that takes time from the main note. Usually half the value of the main note.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Appoggiaturas lean into resolution notes
const withAppoggiaturas = note("[e4 d4] [g4 fs4] [b4 a4] [cs5 d5]")

piano(withAppoggiaturas).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The first note of each pair "leans" into the second.

**Acciaccatura (Grace Note)**: A quick, crushed note played as fast as possible before the main note.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// Quick grace notes before main notes
const withGraceNotes = note("[cs4 d4] [e4 fs4] [gs4 a4] [b4 cs5]")

piano(withGraceNotes).fast(1.1).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Arpeggio**: Breaking a chord by playing its notes in rapid succession rather than simultaneously.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { adagio: 20 }

// D major chord arpeggiated
const arpeggioChord = note("[d3 fs3 a3 d4]")

piano(arpeggioChord).arp("0 1 2 3").cpm(tempo.adagio)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**Glissando**: A slide between two notes, passing through all pitches in between.

**Tremolo**: Rapid repetition of a single note or alternation between two notes.

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const art = { staccato: x => x.sustain(0.1) }
const tempo = { adagio: 20 }

// Tremolo on each chord tone
const tremolo = note("d4*16 fs4*16 a4*16 d5*16")

art.staccato(piano(tremolo)).cpm(tempo.adagio)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

### 4.6 Structural Directions

These terms tell performers about navigation and repetition.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Da Capo (D.C.)** | From the beginning—return to the start |
| **Dal Segno (D.S.)** | From the sign—return to the 𝄋 symbol |
| **Fine** | The end—stop here on repeats |
| **Coda** | Tail—skip to the coda section (marked with 𝄌) |
| **Repeat signs** | Repeat the enclosed section |
| **Prima volta (1.)** | First ending |
| **Seconda volta (2.)** | Second ending |
| **Bis** | Twice—repeat once |
| **Tacet** | Silent—don't play |
| **Attacca** | Attack immediately—proceed without pause |
| **Segue** | Follow—continue to the next section |

**Da Capo aria form (ABA)**: Common in Baroque opera. Sing A, sing B, then D.C. al Fine returns to A.

In Strudel, use `slowcat()` for formal sections. Variables make repeating sections easy:

**Da Capo (D.C.) - ABA form:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

// Define sections once
const sectionA = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4 b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const sectionB = note("a4 b4 cs5 d5 e5 d5 cs5 b4")

// Da Capo: A-B-A (sectionA defined once, used twice!)
piano(slowcat(sectionA, sectionB, sectionA)).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

Section A returns after section B—classic da capo structure. The variable `sectionA` is defined once but used twice!

**First and second endings (Prima/Seconda volta):**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { allegro: 50 }

// Main phrase and endings
const mainPhrase = note("d4 fs4 a4 d5")
const firstEnding = note("cs5 b4 a4 gs4")
const secondEnding = note("a4 fs4 d4 a3")

cat(
  piano(mainPhrase), piano(mainPhrase),
  piano(firstEnding),
  piano(mainPhrase), piano(mainPhrase),
  piano(secondEnding)
).cpm(tempo.allegro)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The pattern plays twice with different endings—first time continues, second time concludes.

**Attacca - continue without pause:**

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const tempo = { moderato: 40 }

const runningPhrase = note("d4 e4 fs4 g4 a4 g4 fs4 e4")
const finalChord = note("[d4,fs4,a4,d5]")

// Attacca: no pause between phrase and chord
cat(
  piano(runningPhrase).sustain(0.8),
  piano(finalChord).sustain(2).gain(0.9)
).cpm(tempo.moderato)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

The phrase flows directly into the final chord with no break—attacca!

## Part 5: Synthesis

### 5.1 Everything Together

Let's see how form, harmony, and texture work together. Here's our theme developed into a complete musical phrase using all the DRY principles from this guide:

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`// === INSTRUMENT LIBRARY ===
const piano = x => x.s('piano')
const voicedPiano = x => x.voicing().s('piano').gain(0.5)
const warmBass = x => x.s('sawtooth').lpf(400).gain(0.4)

// === TEMPO ===
const tempo = { andante: 30 }

// === MELODIC MATERIAL ===
const antecedent = note("fs4 e4 d4 cs4")
const consequent = note("b3 a3 b3 cs4")
const melody = cat(antecedent, consequent)

// === HARMONIC MATERIAL ===
const progression = chord("<D A Bm F#m G D G A>")

// === TEXTURE: Stack melody, chords, bass ===
stack(
  piano(melody),
  voicedPiano(progression),
  warmBass(progression.rootNotes(2).note())
).cpm(tempo.andante)`} punchcard punchcardLabels={false} />

**What's happening:**
- **Form**: Two phrases (antecedent + consequent) forming a period
- **Harmony**: I-V-vi-iii-IV-I-IV-V progression with authentic cadence
- **Texture**: Homophonic—melody over chordal accompaniment with bass line
- **DRY**: Progression defined once, used for both chords and bass!

### 5.2 Classical Concepts in Strudel

| Classical Concept | Strudel Tool | Example |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| Phrase/Section | `cat()` | `cat(phraseA, phraseB)` |
| Large-scale form | `slowcat()` | `slowcat(A, B, A)` |
| Chord progression | `chord()` | `chord("<D A Bm G>")` |
| Voice leading | `.voicing()` | `chord("D").voicing()` |
| Texture layers | `stack()` | `stack(melody, chords, bass)` |
| Canon/imitation | `.late()` | `.late(0.5)` |
| Modulation | `.transpose()` | `.transpose(7)` |
| Augmentation | `.slow()` | `.slow(2)` |
| Diminution | `.fast()` | `.fast(2)` |
| Sequence | `cat()` + transpose | Repeating pattern shifted |
